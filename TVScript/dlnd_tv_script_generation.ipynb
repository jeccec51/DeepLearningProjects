    "**Answer:** \n",
    "It is observed that a larger sequence length helps to back propogate through longer time frame, and hence the networks ability develop long term memory improves. This helps in better losses, but the memory and time complexity increases with increase in this parameters. So as a trade off, 16 is selected. Another factor is, if the sequence length is a power of 2, the internal prcessor computations would be much faster. A gradual increment from 8 to 32, is made, and its found that beyond 16 it takes lot of time to complete the training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large hidden dimentions will help the network to approximate complicated functions. Same logic as number of hidden layers in a FC network. However the backpropogation length increases, casusing extra memory and time ovrheads. A hidden dimention size of 512 is decided, to get a trade off. Again , the parameter being power of 2 helps to improve processor coputation complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Started with a learning rate of 0.001, and tried to gradually improve the same. However, the larger learning rate tends oscillate the loss. Lower learning rates are almost not reducing the loss. So its found 0.0001 is the best initial value. Adams would adaptively modify this rate internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of epochs are selectd after observing  the validation, and training losses. The code for that is developed in PYCHARM IDE, and selected the point where the differences are small, and then both of them saturates. Currently it is set as 10, to achieve the required loss. However, its observed that higher number of epoches further reduces he loss, but will take hours to complete. 10 seems to be a better tradeoff between the time and ojective in hand \n",
    "\n",
    "Number of layers are kept at 2, adding beyond that didnt seems to have any value addition to the performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideal choise of batch size may be 1, meaning we need to do a fw and BW propogation and adjust weight for evry single data. This is practically not possible. If we increase the batch size to infinity, the processr will have to deal with an infinite sized matrix dimentions. Furthermore, the accuracy of wright adjustments will be deteriorated. So as a tradeoff, a batch size of 256 is selected. "
