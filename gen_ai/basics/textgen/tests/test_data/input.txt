Aladdin set out with the merchant and they walked miles after miles. Soon they were in the middle of the desert with nothing or no one around. The merchant took out some red powder, uttered a chant and threw it on the ground. Soon smoke appeared followed by a cave. Aladdin realised that the merchant was actually a magician. He told Aladdin, “Go in and grab all the gold you want but before that bring me this old lamp you will find. I only need that lamp.” Aladdin entered the cave. He was dumbstruck to see all the riches around. He stuffed in as many gold items and gems he could find and then he laid eyes on an old dirty-looking lamp.
When Aladdin returned to the entrance and asked the magician to help him come out of the cave, the magician said, “First hand over the lamp to me then I’ll pull you out.” Aladdin did not trust the man and insisted on being pulled out first. This angered the magician, who threw some more red powder into the cave and closed it. Now, Aladdin was alone in the cave. He shouted for help but there was no one to hear him in the desert or the cave. He then accidentally rubbed the lamp and a genie appeared. Aladdin became fearful of this strange blue creature, thinking it to be some evil magic of the magician.
